This is your generator
=====================================
We have two samples in org.obeonetwork.informationsystem.gen.web.sample with and without play! 2.0 Framework.
If you want to use this generator witout play! 2.0, you will need to create your one REST service or create a STUB.
there are based on the  ChocoApp.application model in org.obeonetwork.informationsystem.gen.web.sample.model. 
(please see the README on this project for more information)

To choose your "MODE" between with or without Play!, 
you can adapte the gen-play-services value in common/org/obeonetwork/informationsystem/gen/web/properties/default.properties.

Note that we find a jbeLibs.zip that contains all static assets that are not deploy automaticly for now.

Note that the play! 2.0 part is experimental and can be clearly enhance.

Note that if you want to create a new application with this generator, you need to create your play! java project before to launch the generation.

Note that this application has a basic login process (oauth) with a github account and the server part is not done for now.

If you want to customize the base url (for example http://mynewurl:8080/), please, proceed like this :
. Go on your github account 
. Select "applications"
. Click on "Register new application"
. name : "http://mynewurl/", URL : "http://mynewurl:8080", Callback URL : "http://mynewurl:8080"
. Set Client ID, Client Secret, Base URL and Port up-to-date in your properties file (by default /org.obeonetwork.informationsystem.gen.web/common/org/obeonetwork/informationsystem/gen/web/properties/default.properties)
. Make a new generation.
